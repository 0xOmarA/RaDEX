RaDEX is a prototype CFMM build on the Radix network to showcase how Uniswap-like DEXs can be built with Scrypto and the PTE on Radix. 

This repository has the scrypto code required for the DEX to operate, bootstrapping code required to get the DEX to run on the PTE and setup the liquidity pools, in the root of the repo, is the react project used to create the dApp's website. 

The [README.md](./scrypto-package/README.md) in the scrypto package explains how the DEX's blueprints work and the functionalities that they have. 

The [README.md](./bootstrap/README.md) in the bootstrap directory explains what this crate does and its functionality.
